# Fallout Terminal

The factory terminal entries are entries within the accessible factory in South Boston in Fallout 4. 

The program is a fully working code, where you can read terminal entries and opening doors like in the real Fallout game. You get only access when you master the password game. 
You can find wrong entries with triple characters like ### or /// to get more tries. Just type them in and press Enter.

When you have less than 3 stars in intelligence,
you can use as a universal password:
"ROBCO"
to enter the menu.

You need python3 for this project:
