Strange call from Lavonne. Haven't seen her since the briefing
room in Portland, and now she calls me up about her nephew's
baseball team? She must have been speaking in code, and I
don't like what I think she meant. Sending the team home to 
be with their families. I'll just say it's a Union thing.
