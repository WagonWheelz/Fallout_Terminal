I was sleeping in my chair when it happened. They must have
missed the city with the big one - Framingham's gone from
what little I heard on the radio before it went quiet.
Things aren't too good here, either. At least I've got my 
little castle here to hole up in. I'd probably have been
vaporized if I had been doing my regular thing when it came.

Thanks, Lavonne...
