If my time overseas taught me one thing, it's that war changes
people. When I first laced my boots in Georgia I thought
enlisting the Army was just a way to blow shit up in the name
of God and Uncle Sam. I was a self-centered kid who wanted to
play with guns. Now I understand what service
really means, and what looking out for this bunch of teamsters
means, too.

It may not be the same as guard duty for a camp of 800
soldiers, but it's something.
